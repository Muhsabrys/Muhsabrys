My research interests include corpus, computational, psycho, socio, and cognitive linguistics. I'm also interested in digital humanities and Big Data. I work as an EFL instructor at the English Language Resource Center (ELRC), Al-Azhar University, and Higher Education Initiative (HEI), AMIDEAST Egypt.
