"Reading in L2 is not only a means of learning the language and acquiring some skills, but also a path for the studentsâ€™ personal development. Unfortunately, the reading experience in any educational institution does not encourage independent reading as the materials for reading are preset and usually are from the classics. The Reading Circles create an authentic and interesting reading experience for students as everything is up to them in these circles with a minimal interference from the teacher. Reading Circles are one of the best ways to produce avid readers who will read for their own pleasure outside any educational institution."
