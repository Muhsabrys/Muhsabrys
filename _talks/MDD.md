"The present study investigates positive and negative Judgments of Social Esteem, e.g., ability, and Social Sanction, e.g., ethics, (Martin and White, 2005) in the written narratives of individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The study aims at revealing how MDD patients make judgments about themselves and about other individuals in their lives, e.g., parents, spouses, and friends. To do so, narratives written by patients who self-reported their diagnoses with MDD were collected form online mental health forums. For the purposes of locating expressions of Judgment in the collected corpus, the corpus tool SketchEngine was used with the help of syntactic fields of adjectives (SFAs). Results of the study indicate that 85% of Judgment expressions belonged to the category of Social Esteem, whereas 15% of the utterances fell under the category of Social Sanctions. Further, Positive Judgment evaluations (64%) were more recurrent than their negative counterparts (36%). Also, the subcategory of Capacity represented more than 70% of all Judgements made by MDD patients. Thematic analysis shows that patientsâ€™ capacity to perform body functions and bravery in fighting the disorder are the most frequent positive judgments, whereas their inability to perform well at their work or schools dominated their negative judgments. With regard to others-oriented-judgments, patients acclaimed the therapeutic role of their therapists as well as the support they received from their families and friends; however, they strongly condemned those who exposed them to psychological, verbal, sexual, domestic, and racial violence. Finally, the two SFAs [adjective+to+verb], e.g., able to fight, and [adjective+of], e.g., aware of, resulted in 43% of Judgments made by MDD patients."
