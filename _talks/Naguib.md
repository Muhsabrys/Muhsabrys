"In this talk we present Naguib (after the Arab literary Nobel Laureate, Naguib Mahfouz), a model for a fine-grained computational analysis of Arabic literary texts, with a special focus on novels. The main idea in Naguib is that a literary text is essentially a sequence of linguistic signals selected by the author to perform a set of narrative functions, such as settings, affect, tone, mood, character, theme, plot and dialogue. The core of the model is a novel-oriented lexical-conceptual taxonomy that maps the textual signals into these narrative functions. In this talk, we present the details of this model and the results of its application in analyzing a sample of Arabic novels and identifying the lexical-conceptual and cultural DNA of the given text. This is work in progress with the ultimate purpose of providing a robust suite of tools for researchers in the domains of literary and cultural studies and related fields for a deeper and richer analysis of Arabic literary texts on a much larger scale."
