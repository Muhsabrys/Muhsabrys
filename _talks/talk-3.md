"Patients with mental health disorders narrate their reflections on their health conditions oftentimes to ask for support, fight the mental health stigma, or give explanations for certain related behaviors. By analyzing the language of such narratives, clearer perception and deeper understanding of the nature of mental health disorders could be obtained (Coppersmith et al, 2015). Adopting Martin and White’s (2005) Appraisal theory, which attends to how speakers express their evaluations of attitude, engagement, and graduation through language, this study aims at investigating the language of affect (a subtype of attitude) in the online written narratives of bipolar disorder patients. The study aims at revealing how these individuals feel about themselves, i.e. the types of emotion that characterize their narratives. In order to conduct a fine-grained emotion analysis, the study employs Plutchik's (2001) categorization of emotion into eight types: joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, anticipation, disgust, and surprise. Antconc text analysis toolkit is used for locating the emotional expressions in the narratives corpus using Bednarek’s (2009) linguistic patterns of affect. Preliminary results show that fear, sadness, and anticipation respectively represent the most frequent types of emotion in the analyzed narratives."
